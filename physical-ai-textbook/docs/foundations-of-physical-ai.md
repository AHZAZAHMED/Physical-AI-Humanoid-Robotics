# Foundations of Physical AI

Physical AI represents a paradigm shift from traditional AI systems that operate purely in digital spaces to AI systems that interact with and understand the physical world. This module introduces the core concepts that differentiate Physical AI from conventional AI approaches.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI encompasses AI systems that are designed to interact with the physical world through sensors and actuators. Unlike traditional AI that processes abstract data, Physical AI must handle real-world uncertainties, noise, and the continuous nature of physical systems.

## Key Challenges

1. **Real-time Processing**: Physical systems require immediate responses to environmental changes
2. **Uncertainty Management**: Sensors provide noisy data that must be filtered and interpreted
3. **Embodied Cognition**: The physical form of the robot influences its cognitive processes
4. **Multi-modal Integration**: Combining data from various sensors (vision, touch, proprioception)
5. **Safety and Reliability**: Physical systems must operate safely in human environments

## Applications in Humanoid Robotics

Humanoid robots represent the pinnacle of Physical AI, requiring sophisticated integration of perception, planning, and control to achieve human-like capabilities. These systems must navigate complex environments, interact with diverse objects, and communicate effectively with humans.

## Theoretical Foundations

The theoretical underpinnings of Physical AI draw from several disciplines:

- Control Theory: For system stability and response
- Computer Vision: For environmental perception
- Machine Learning: For adaptive behavior
- Robotics: For kinematics and dynamics
- Cognitive Science: For human-like decision making
