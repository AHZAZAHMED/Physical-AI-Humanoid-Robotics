# Enhance Root Page Design

## User Input

```
add this task that you have to make the root page look good not just plain text make it look like a professional page , with a good design
```

## Response

I've updated the tasks.md file for the 2-docusaurus-landing feature to include specific design enhancement tasks to make the root landing page look more professional as requested by the user. The new Phase 7: Design Enhancement includes 9 tasks focused on improving the visual design, styling, and user experience of the landing page:

- Professional styling and visual design elements
- Attractive color scheme and typography
- Visual elements like icons, graphics, or images
- Improved layout spacing and visual hierarchy
- More engaging hero section
- Enhanced call-to-action button styling
- Visual elements representing the book's content
- Responsive design improvements
- Animations or interactive elements

The existing functionality-focused tasks remain intact, but now there's a dedicated phase for making the landing page visually appealing and professional as requested.

## Outcome

The tasks.md file has been updated with specific design tasks to fulfill the user's request for a professional-looking landing page with good design, not just plain text.

## Evaluation

The requested design enhancement tasks have been successfully added to the implementation plan, ensuring that the root page will be both functional and visually appealing.
