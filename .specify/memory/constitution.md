# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book Constitution

## Vision
To create an accessible, comprehensive educational resource that empowers beginners and intermediate learners to understand, build, and work with Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics systems through hands-on practice and real-world applications.

## Core Principles

### I. Hands-On Learning First
Every concept must be accompanied by practical, executable examples that readers can run, modify, and experiment with. Theoretical explanations must be immediately followed by tangible implementations that readers can reproduce and build upon themselves.

### II. Progressive Complexity
Content must follow a clear progression from basic to advanced concepts, ensuring beginners can follow along while providing sufficient depth for intermediate learners. Each chapter builds upon previous knowledge with clear prerequisites stated.

### III. Documentation-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All examples, code, and projects must be documented using Docusaurus with clear setup instructions, prerequisites, and expected outcomes. Every code snippet must be tested and verified to work in the documented environment.

### IV. Cross-Platform Compatibility
All examples and tools must work across major operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows) with platform-specific instructions clearly marked. Dependencies must be manageable through standard package managers or containerization.

### V. Safety-First Approach
All physical AI and robotics content must include safety considerations, best practices, and risk assessments. Hardware recommendations must include appropriate safety warnings and protective measures for readers.

### VI. Accessibility and Clarity
Content must be written in clear, jargon-free language with complex concepts broken down into digestible parts. Visual aids, diagrams, and step-by-step instructions are required for all complex procedures.

## Success Criteria
- Beginner readers can successfully complete at least 80% of hands-on exercises
- Intermediate readers find new insights and practical applications
- All code examples run successfully in documented environments
- Book receives positive feedback for clarity and practical value
- Docusaurus-based documentation is well-organized, searchable, and user-friendly

## Constraints
- Target Audience: Beginners to intermediate learners (no expert-only content)
- Tech Stack: Docusaurus for documentation and website
- Focus: Hands-on learning with practical projects and examples
- Hardware: Examples should work with accessible, affordable robotics platforms
- Content: Must include both simulation and real-world implementation approaches

## Stakeholders
- Primary: Beginners and intermediate learners interested in Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics
- Secondary: Educators using the book as course material, hobbyists, researchers
- Contributors: Technical reviewers, community contributors, documentation maintainers

## Brand Voice
Approachable yet authoritative, encouraging experimentation while emphasizing safety and best practices. The tone should inspire curiosity and confidence in readers while maintaining technical accuracy. Use clear, supportive language that makes complex topics feel achievable.

## Governance

All content must comply with this constitution. Updates to the book content require verification that they maintain hands-on learning focus, accessibility for target audience, and safety considerations. Any changes to core principles require explicit review and approval from the editorial team.
